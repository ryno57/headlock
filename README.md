# HeadLock *(working title)*

**Welcome!**  
This is my second game project, currently in early development. I'm learning as I go, so big features may take time, but I'm fully committed to building something ambitious and unique.

## What is HeadLock?

Project GP is a **Adventure/survival and managing game**.  
You’ll build have to survive while travelling the space, switching between managing and exploring.

### Planned Features for Final Release:
-  SpaceShip customization
-  Dynamic world events affecting you and your adventure
-  Deep managing systems: food, water, oxygen, etc
-  procedural planet and more!

> These features may evolve over time, for better or worse as development progresses.

## Current Development Status

As of **October 23, 2025**, I’m actively working on **Build 1.0**.  
This version focuses on adding some hud and polish test map.

### Build 1.x Goals:
-  reworking movement system
-  Visual overhaul of the test Map *(currently just a black grid floor and a some cubes)*

##  Stay tuned

I’ll be updating this repo regularly as I learn and build.
